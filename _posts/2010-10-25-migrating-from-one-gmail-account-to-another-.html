title: Migrating from one gmail account to another .
published: true
---
<p>So i had this gmail ID that i once felt was uber-cool and not anymore. So i decided to move on to another gmail account , with a proper name. I had some 28 filters and 33 labels in my old gmail account . So here is how i went about it :</p>
<div>First enable labs in gmail , and then the <em>filter import , export</em> lab in gmail .</div>
<div>Export all your gmail labels , import into your new account using the same gmail lab feature.</div>
<p />
<div>Unsubscribe from all the google-groups and all other mailing lists , when you click show details on an email , there is a chance that you will find ,</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">unsubscribe</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style=""><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Unsubscribe from this mailing-list</span></blockquote>
<div>clicking on it will auto-send the unsubscribe message to the list .Once you've unsubscribed from all of those , go ahead and subscribe using your new account .</div>
<div>However ,do not&nbsp;unsubscribe&nbsp;in case you were a manager in google groups -- you will be unsubscribed and no more a manager : ( .</div>
<p />
<div>Export all your contacts to google CSV , import it from other account .</div>
<p />
<div>Set all forwards from&nbsp;your&nbsp;various gmail/email addresses to your new accounts .</div>
<p />
<div>The worst part is buzz , which i am wondering how to migrate.</div>
<div>Now there is another tough part of managing chats , i cant add all these contacts to chat as it will send them all the gmail invitations , and sending gmail invitation to a mailing list is a stupidity i've done earlier and don't want to repeat .</div>
<div>So that was a test post for learning to type and to test if i could post to posterous from my new mail Id too.</div>
