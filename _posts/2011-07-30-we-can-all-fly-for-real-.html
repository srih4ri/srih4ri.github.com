It is a Saturday evening, I am moderately demotivated.I was looking around for some light reading like <a href="http://thebloggess.com/2011/06/and-thats-why-you-should-learn-to-pick-your-battles/">big metal chickens.</a> Since such good things are rare ,I was at hn/twitter ,to reach <span></span><a href="http://jcromartie.tumblr.com/post/8255551864/reading-hacker-news-is-not-launching">Reading Hacker News is not launching</a> to reach <a href="http://www.anyasq.com/227-i-made-bingo-card-creator">anyasq</a> .Then I come across this tale :<p /> <a href="http://www.anyasq.com/195-i-sent-a-balloon-to-space-and-photographed-venus-for-less-than-$200">http://www.anyasq.com/195-i-sent-a-balloon-to-space-and-photographed-venus-for-less-than-$200</a><p />This is marvellously inspiring because :<br /> 1) It is about sky.<br />2) It is about going UP to the sky.<br />3) It is about actually doing it with your college mates.<p />That is a one hell of a life to live <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/ManuSharma_Aero">Manu Sharma</a>, your story tells me , what our boundaries and limits are :<br /> They are mere excuses our lazy mind makes up,there are non-existent like the thin air between you and sky.And like <a href="http://twitter.com/ismudnx">ismu</a> told me , we all can fly for real - we just forgot how to go into that mode.<p /> BTW A<a href="http://about.me/mdeepu1"> lion </a>is learning to <a href="http://mystartupblog.posterous.com/">speak</a>.Our tales of hunting will be questioned...
