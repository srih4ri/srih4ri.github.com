I am learning vi , partly because my job demands it and partly because it is a cool editor .<div>Things i knew already :</div><div>To open a text file in vi type</div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> $ vi mytextfile</blockquote><div>This is the most important part you&#39;ve to get past as a beginner :</div><div>In your normal text editor , you can always write new text or delete or change text in the file you have opened .</div> <p /><div>In vi , you can be in writing mode (normal-text-editor like behavior , its called insert-mode or something) , and this is NOT the mode you&#39;ll be in once you&#39;ve opened a file , when in insert mode --Insert-- will be displayed at the bottom . </div> <div>To get into the insert mode you&#39;ve to press <b>i </b>or <b>a </b>, now you can edit text .</div><p /><div>For saving the file , hit the escape key to escape from the insert-mode . Now you are no longer in insert mode , type <b>:wq </b><i>yes, colon w and q </i>. to write the file and quit from vi . </div> <div> For quitting withour saving hit <b>:q! .</b></div><p /><div>Things i learned yesterday :</div><div>To delete an entire line of text get out of insert mode , move your cursor to the line you want using the arrow keys or the h j k l keys(<i>BTW j and k are valid shortcut for same purpose in gmail and twitter </i>) now hit <b>dd , <span style="font-weight: normal;">and the line is gone !</span></b></div> <p /><div><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Things i learned today :</span></b></div><p /><div><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">I had to find some text in the file i opened , i have to first get out of the insert-mode by hitting ESC and then type / (<i>thats a slash) </i>followed by the word to find .Now hit enter to find the first occurrence and then hit </span>n </b>to move to the next occurrence .</div> <div>SO </div><div>i -- insert-mode</div><div>:wq -- write and quit</div><div>:q! -- quit without writing</div><div>/word -- search for word</div><div>n -- find next occurrence of word</div><div>dd - delete a line of text</div> <div>u -- undo </div><p /><div>Tomorrow i need to know more about copying and pasting . Heard it is powerful.</div><p /><div>So i&#39;ve got started , hoping to learn more soon .</div><div>:wq</div>
