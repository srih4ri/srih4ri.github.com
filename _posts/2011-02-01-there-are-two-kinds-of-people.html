There are two kinds of people , those who know things and those who don&#39;t know things . This post is for the second kind of people.<br />Dear ones ,<br />You don&#39;t know things because you are not ready to listen, You don&#39;t know things because you discourage people trying to tell you things. You are reluctant to learn.You just suck at learning things.<br /> When someone tells you something , whoever it be , you are supposed to listen to them.<br />What is wrong with you? Why do you say &quot;I know that &quot; when someone tries to tell you something? <br />DONT SAY THAT EVEN IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS BEING TOLD TO YOU.<br /> This is the one single thing that separates you from the people who know things.<br />So next time someone tells you something , be quiet and listen.
