Dear friend ,<br />If ever you have given me that look or told me that i was crap because i used linux for my computer unlike you , here is an explanation for you<p />I started using linux(opensuse-&gt;ubuntu-&gt;archlinux) at home after a year of windows , for three years. After a month out of college , i  started off as a ruby on rails developer.The computer i got at work had windows XP installed , i learnt ruby and rails on it .I was uncomfortable , but it was ok , there was no virus , so it was not choking to use windows .Besides i did not want to be given that &quot;why-are-you-wearing-your-underwear-over-your-pants&quot; look from my team mates <p /> Then i started getting sick of windows again.This time it was not the virus . it was the command line , <br /><ul><li>It had no tab completion</li><li>It had not grep </li><li>I was not good browsing through the windows directory structure.</li> <li>You had to type <i>ruby script/server</i> when back home in my bash i just needed to type <i>script/server</i></li><li>I could not detach the mongrel/webrick instance , One windows was always to be open for server . </li> <li>You could not tab-complete at the rails console</li><li>irb felt ugly.</li><li>there was no ps  and no top .<br /></li><li>passenger wouldn&#39;t run nicely in windows (back then this was not a big deal as i did not know what passenger was)</li> </ul>I was fed up , windows was not meant for development , not for me atleast .<br />Most of the rails guys used mac , I couldn&#39;t  -- I had only a PC and i had a general dislike for mac.<br />Somebody already sick of cmd had installed console^2 , but it did not help much.<p /> Finally i made my decision , i now use ubuntu 10.04 + netbeans for ruby on rails development .<p /> And above all i got a kalashnikov instead of a stick , i got a decent *nix terminal . I am a happier developer .<p />What i know now is ,  the best OS is where you can make the best use of your computer . For many it is the windows , for some it is the mac . But for me , it is definitely GNU/linux . &lt;3
