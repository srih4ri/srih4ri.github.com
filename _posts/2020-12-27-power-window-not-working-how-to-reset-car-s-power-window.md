If your car's power window doesn't go all the way down or up on its own - the first thing to try is to reset it.

This happened to me after a car's service. Since the car's battery was removed, it must've caused some glitch in the power window mechanism. The driver side power window wouldn't come all they way down on it's own when I pressed the button. 

After searching online, I found that the window can be reset.

For a Ford Figo ( Ford Ka+) , this can be done by pressing the power window button down for ten-seconds, and then pulling it up for ten seconds.

For your car, look up instructions on owner's manual or the car company's website on how to reset the power window. 

I did not know that car's power window was something that could be reset - hence the note.
