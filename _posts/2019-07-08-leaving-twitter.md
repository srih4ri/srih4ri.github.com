# Leaving twitter.

Quitting is a strong word. I am probably going to return to twitter someday. 

But for now, here is how I have been off twitter for the last 7 months and 15 days. 

It is really very easy - Unfollow everyone!

Yes, let me repeat that, UNFOLLOW EVERYONE.

Doing this results in a twitter feed that looks like this : 




This means that there's no satisfaction in checking your feed every now and then whenever you get some seconds of free time.

This broke the twitter habit for me. Before this, whenever I found two minutes of free time - CI Running ? Check twitter. Waiting for someone to respond? Check twitter.
