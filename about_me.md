I work remotely at [BigBinary](http://bigbinary.com) on React JS and Rails projects. I have also written a few blogs on the [BigBinary Blog](http://blog.bigbinary.com).

Previously at [Bang The Table](http://bangthetable.com), I worked with the team who built [EngagementHQ](http://engagementhq.com). I had my first lessons of working remotely here. I learned more about optimizing performance of a rails application, tackling spam and building web apps. This for me was also an introduction to the field of community engagement. I also worked on building the new [BudgetAllocator](budgetallocator.com) - a participatory budgeting software for local governments.

Before this job, I spent six months with my friends trying to start up. It tanked.

My interest in python and linux found me my first job as a programmer at [Foradian](foradian.com). In the two years that I spent here, building 'Sampoornaâ€™ was one of my longest running and challenging feats. Sampoorna is still used by the Kerala State's Education Department in all their schools as a school management software. This was my first lesson in scale and enterprise software.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication in 2010.

I wrote my first computer programs in notebooks, in my BASIC class.
