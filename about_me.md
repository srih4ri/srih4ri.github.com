I wrote my first computer programs in notebooks, in my BASIC class. This went on for five years and ended in a snooker game’s animation being written in BASIC.

In the break I got before I joined my Engineering classes, I learned C. I was excited to build the progress report program for a class.

During my engineering classes, I went to java programming classes. I have forgotten most of it, I can only identify java when I see it. I got introduced to Free Software Movement and started using linux. I learned python attempting to write a status message plugin for Pidgin.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication in 2010.

My interest in python and linux got me into my first job as a programmer at [Foradian](foradian.com). I learned Ruby on Rails here. In two years that I spent here, building 'Sampoorna’ was one of longest running and challenging feats. This app is used by Kerala State's Education Department in all its Government Schools as a School management Software. This was my first lesson in scale and enterprise software.
Foradian is also where I learnt about source control systems, project management, and every other tool you need when you grow up from single file programs to software that supports businesses.

I spent six months working with my friends trying to start up - it failed miserably.

My next job was at [BangtheTable](bangthetable.com) . I had my first lessons of TDD here. I worked here with a team that was upgrading their successful product to a new multi-tenant platform. I had my first lessons of working remotely here. I learned more about how to improve a rails app’s performance, How to tackle spam, how to compartment multiple tenant’s data here. This for me was also a introduction to the field of community engagement. One of my long running projects here was building the upgraded [BudgetAllocator](budgetallocator.com) - a multi-tenant application based on bangthetable’s existing product. This is also where I had my first taste of React.

I joined Bigbinary after that. I learned how software contractors work. I worked full time remote here. Building the backend for one of India’s largest online medicine retail app gave me my first experience on building e-commerce backends.
